Interactive Development Assignment 1

Project Name: Calisthenics Store
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Essentially, my website is about a Company/Person that is promoting their services which are
Calisthenics related like Training Programs and equipment. Calisthenics is basically just exercises
done using your bodyweight (Fun Fact: Most skills/exercises are taken from gymnastics!). 
Of course there are interesting skills like Planche where one holds their body horizontal to the floor
with only their hands touching the floor (arms straight).
I chose this topic basically because I like Calisthenics so I though it would be a good idea to do an
assignment on it


Design Process:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well the design process is quite simple honestly. I searched around for a nice looking logo that
will stay on the top center of the site. After finding one (https://www.pngwing.com/en/free-png-yflbh)
Next was thinking about how to allocate stuff around on the site. Then I just had a eureka moment 
where I was like "why don't I just create nice looking coloured boxes and put the contents inside it.
Afterwards, for inspiration for what to include on the site. I looked to a guy, Simonster, website 
(https://simonsterstrength.com/).

I designed this website for someone who wants to start working out/exercising or new to calisthenics.
When you are new, you would want to know what to do and how to do it. I linked some video resources
that they can watch for free to get started. This is to build customer trust and rapport so that
next time, they are more likely to buy the equipments and programs sold on my site.


Existing Features:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

➡ Feature 1: A Navigation Bar - Allows users to get to different page just by clicking the
buttons on the top (wanted to make it sticky but for some reason it doesn't work here despite
working on one of my other website made for another assignment)

➡ Feature 2: A Back-to-Top Button - Allows users to get back quickly to the top by clicking the
back-to-top button that appears on the bottonm right when the user scrolls down the page

➡ Feature 3: Buy Now Button - Allows user to quickly buy any item by clicking on it (although to make
a proper checkout page, I would most likely need JavaScript thus, I made a simple form instead)

➡ Feature 4: Signup Page - Allows user to signup/register to be a member of our brand on the SignUp Page (although the form currently does not submit the results anywhere)


Features Left to Implement:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

➡ A Proper Checkout Page like normal Online Stores

➡ A Contact Us Footer that allows the user to get our email/branch location quickly at the bottom of each page

➡ Contact Us Page that gives the user a more in-depth info on how to contact our Company/Brand as well as a form to quickly send their feedback to us straight away. 

➡ A NavBar that sticks to top of the page even when the user scrolls down.


Testing:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

➡ Navbar doesnt want to stick to top for some reason.

➡ The 2 images at the Training Programs Page (Basics Mastery Section) doesnt want to be at the same
height (most likely due to the different resolution sizes of the 2 image) and changing the padding
doesn't really help.

➡ The Right hand media on the Handstand Mastery Section of Training Programs is actually a video
but the controls doesn't want to show itself normally (despite putting control in the video tag)
and needs the user to right click it and show control. I have no idea why cause the video right below
it has the controls naturally shows.
