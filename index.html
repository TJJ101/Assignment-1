                    Calisthenics ,which comes from the Ancient Greek Word kalós (καλός) 
                    and sthenos (σθένος) which means beautiful and strength, 
                    is a form of exercise that strives to achieve full body mastery 
                    through the use of bodyweight movements. It consists of various movements
                    from different disicplines, although majority of advanced skills are taken
                    from gymnastics which some would argue is technically counted as Calisthenics
                    as well.

                    Back when it first originated, it was the go to way of exercising.
                    However, when people invented weights and so on, weightlifting became the
                    go to way of getting stronger. However, in the past few years,
                    calisthenics has been slowly gaining traction again. Part of the reason
                    was also because of Covid-19 which made going to the commerical gym not
                    a viable option for many people.

                Not only that, Calisthenics can essentially be done anywhere since 
                it requires little to no equipment at all compared to traditional weightlifting. <br>
                Not only is it convenient, it is also a safer choice considering the situation

                        Build a Solid Foundation
                    </div><br><hr><br>
                    Calisthenics is similar to building a house. To last long, a solid 
                    foundation is necessary. Not only would it make future progress easier
                    when you have a solid foundation, it also greatly reduces the risks of
                    injuries when you attempt harder skills. Thus, when you first start off, 
                    you should focus primarily on the basic. Only after mastering the basics 
                    like pushups, pullups and so on, can you start working on and focus on 
                    more advanced skills like the Planche, Front Lever, Handstand Pushup 
                    and many more.

                        Quality and Consistency
                    </div><br><hr><br>
                    Quality and Consistency would take you very far. If you are super hardcore
                    but only for a few months, that's worst than someone who trains less hard 
                    but more consistent. Consistency is what will give you life long results.
                    You may have heard the saying "Practice makes perfect", however I argue
                    that "Perfect practice makes perfect". If your practice is bad, you would
                    be good at being bad. Thus, quality of each rep of your exercises matters 
                    more than the amount.
